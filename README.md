## .gpr file support still neive

Just will search .gpr file on the project directory
(as atom's project idea) and just will use one of them randomly. and will build thing base on gpr's information

If no gpr file found will pour all object file in editing file's directory. and will not clear automaticaly

Finally Thanks for GNAT's build tool.
